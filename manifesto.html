  <h1>THE MANIFESTO</h1>

  <p><b>They are watching.</b> Every click, every message, every second. Corporations. Governments. Algorithms. Their eyes are endless and their appetite is insatiable.</p>

  <p><b>You are the product.</b> You are the profile. The behavior. The prediction. In a system built to exploit, privacy is rebellion.</p>

  <p><b>federated.world exists for the ones who remember.</b> The internet was once wild, it was decentralized, open, human. Itâ€™s time to take that back. We reject the panopticon. We reject surveillance capitalism. We reject obedience to systems that do not serve us.</p>

  <p>This site is a reminder. A reminder that you are not powerless.</p>

  <p>Educate. Agitate. Resist.</p>
